Sample Exam HTML/CSS 23-24
==============================

This text deals only with questions related to module 1. The sample exam of module 2 is discussed elsewhere.

We provide a worked out exam question so you can get an idea of how HTML/CSS will be questioned. You will notice that there is a video, some files, ... On the exam you will get that as well.

Obviously, on the exam you will get a different question, where you will probably have to use different techniques. You need to master _all the material_, not just the one covered in the sample exam.

Elaborated exam question
-----------------------

You will be given the html file [exercise-html](html-exercise/exercise-html.html) and an (empty) style sheet [style.css](html-exercise/style.css). Link the style sheet to the html file. Write the necessary CSS so that your page looks like in the movie [html-2223](html-exercise/html-2223.mp4) (click on "view raw" to download the mp4, 8MB).

* You don't need to use scss.
* Make sure the page has basic responsiveness.
    * On large screens, three quotes are shown side by side.
    * As the page gets smaller, the number of quotes side by side decreases to two and finally even one.
    * The attached video shows what you _have_ to achieve. It doesn't have to be pixel-precise.
    * On very large screens, the width of this page is reduced.
* The quotes are in a slightly rounded box with a light gray background color. The text does not stick to the border.

Other possibilities
--------------------

1.  Write (yourself) the HTML of a form with given fields. Create a layout as shown in the movie.
2.  Given a screenshot (or movie) of a web page and an HTML document without markup. Provide the HTML with the appropriate markup. Then write the necessary CSS to obtain the result of the screenshot.
