Sample exam JS 23-24
==============================

You will be given the January 2023 exam as a sample exam. Unlike then, exam 23-24 will have a separate HTML/CSS question and a separate set of JS questions. The format of the exam otherwise remains unchanged. 



**Before you begin**

* This week (= a few days before actual exam) we published a new version of the back-end via Toledo. If you have not installed it yet, you can download it [here](ExamVersion-TheGamesLibraryBackend.zip). If you have already done this, you may skip the following steps.
* Extract the zip file to your hard disk.
* Start the back-end using the **npm start** command. You do not need to do **npm install**!
* During the exam there will be no more help with starting the back-end. 

**Start the exam**

* You can also download the assignment bundle you already have on paper as [PDF (DUTCH)](opgave-januari-2023).
* You can download the zip file with starter code [here](startcode_students).
* The assignment refers to 2 movies that give you an idea of the result to be achieved: [questions123.mov](questions123.mov) and [question4.mov](question4.mov).

**Submit**

* When you finish the exam, you must submit this assignment.
* Make a zip file of your exam assignment and attach it while submitting. **Read carefully in the assignment what exactly you need to hand in and what name you need to give to this zip**.
* ** **Important:** Before clicking "Submit" check the zip file again by unzipping it and making sure everything is included. We cannot correct a corrupt or incomplete zip file, you will receive a 0.
* Exit the exam environment with the button "Exit exam" on the left below the course menu.
